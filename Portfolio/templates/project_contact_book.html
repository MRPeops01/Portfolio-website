                    The Contact Book App is a simple yet powerful desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It
                    allows users to easily store, view, and manage their personal or professional contacts in one place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can add new contacts by entering a name and phone number, view all saved contacts in a clean
                    list interface, and delete unwanted entries with a single click. All information is securely stored
                    in a local SQLite database for persistent access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project is developed using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical interface and SQLite for
                    database management. The combination provides a lightweight, fast, and user-friendly experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of building this project was setting up the database integration with
                    Tkinterâ€™s event-driven interface to ensure real-time updates and persistent data storage.
