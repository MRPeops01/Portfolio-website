        <h2>How my coding journey started</h2>
        <section>
            <p>My coding journey started in 2nd grade when my parents had a surprise for me and my brother.</p>
            <p>We arrived at a place called Code Ninjas, where we could learn how to code.</p>
            <p>After the first class, we loved it and kept going.</p>
            <p>We had to stop though when I started playing basketball; I was an orange belt when I stopped.</p>
            <p>When we were on a travel team, one of my brother's teammate's dad knew a lot about coding.</p>
            <p>He told me to look at courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com" target="_blank">Udemy</a>, where you
                could take courses on anything.</p>
            <p>When I took my first Python course, I loved it and decided that I wanted to be a software and web
                developer.</p>
